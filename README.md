Progress Log:

2/9/2022: In addition to establishing the page's contents in HTML, I have implemented the start and reset features in JavaScript. Some of the remaining items include: (1) creating a functioning stop button, (2) adding CSS to enhance the page's aesthetics, and (3) conducting a final revision of the code for quality.
