This project is still ongoing. See the progress log below for additional information.

Progress Log:

2/9/2022: In addition to establishing the page's contents in HTML, I have implemented the start and reset features in JavaScript. Some of the remaining items include: (1) creating a functioning stop button, (2) adding CSS to enhance the page's aesthetics, and (3) conducting a final revision of the code for quality.

2/10/2022: I revised the JavaScript that I wrote yesterday. One of the differences is that I used setInterval instead of setTimeout. I also did away with the if statements in favor of a more simplified approach (which can now be seen). The remaining items as of today include: (1) adding CSS to enhance the page's aesthetics, and (2) conducting a final revision of the code for quality.
